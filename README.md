diffusion_tumor_capillary_vessels
=================================

MATLAB code for the:

Simulation of the VEGF diffusion
from a tumor to a pre-existing vessel network
inducing angiogenesis (depending on the VEGF concentration near the vessel)

To run this program you will need two .xls files, one named tumor and one named vessel.
These files are the 2-dimensional grid on which the simulation is occurring.

Both .xls files' dimensions will have to be 500x500.
All cells that have the number "1" in it will be counted as part of the tumor and the vessel respectively.
